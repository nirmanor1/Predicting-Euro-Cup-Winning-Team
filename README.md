## Introduction

This repository contains the code and resources for predicting the outcome of international football matches, specifically focusing on whether the home team wins. The dataset includes comprehensive records of matches from 1872 to 2024. The project involves data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, and applying machine learning models to make predictions.

## Data

The data used in this project is sourced from a dataset of international football results available on Kaggle. It includes over 40,000 matches with details such as:

- Match date
- Home team

## Usage

1. **Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset to understand its structure and contents. This step includes visualizing the data and identifying key patterns.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the data for modeling by handling missing values, creating new features, and normalizing data.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Generate new features that may help improve model performance, such as win rates, average goals, and head-to-head statistics.
4. **Model Training**: Train multiple machine learning models to predict the match outcome. Compare the performance of different models.
5. **Clustering**: Apply clustering algorithms to group teams based on their performance and other attributes.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

This project leverages a variety of machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict football match outcomes. Below are detailed descriptions of the algorithms used:

### Classification Algorithms

1. **Logistic Regression**: A statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable. It is useful for predicting whether the home team wins or not.
   
2. **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the mode of the classes for classification tasks. It is robust to overfitting and can handle a large number of features.

3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A supervised learning model that analyzes data for classification and regression analysis. It is effective in high-dimensional spaces and when the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples.

### Clustering Algorithms

1. **K-Means Clustering**: A method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. It helps in grouping teams based on performance metrics.

2. **Hierarchical Clustering**: A method of cluster analysis which seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters. Strategies for hierarchical clustering generally fall into two types: Agglomerative and Divisive.

3. **Mean Shift Clustering**: A non-parametric clustering technique that does not require specifying the number of clusters in advance. It is particularly effective for identifying arbitrarily shaped clusters.

### Dimension Reduction Algorithms

1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: A statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. PCA is used for reducing the dimensionality of the data while retaining most of the variance.

2. **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**: A machine learning algorithm for dimensionality reduction that is particularly well suited for the visualization of high-dimensional datasets. t-SNE is used to visualize the high-dimensional data in a two-dimensional space to better understand the data structure and potential clusters.

### Additional Algorithms for Enhanced Insights

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric method used for classification and regression. It is used in the exploratory data analysis phase to understand the similarity between matches and teams.

2. **Gradient Boosting**: A machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which builds a model in a stage-wise fashion from weak learners and generalizes them by optimizing an arbitrary differentiable loss function.

### Performance Evaluation

- **Accuracy**: Measures the number of correct predictions made divided by the total number of predictions.
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**: These metrics are especially useful for classification problems where the class distribution is imbalanced.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Provides a detailed breakdown of correct and incorrect classifications.

### Visualization and Interpretation

Visualization plays a crucial role in understanding the performance and impact of different features. The project uses various plotting libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to create informative visualizations such as:

- Correlation heatmaps to identify the relationship between features.
- Bar plots to visualize the distribution of goals scored.
- Box plots and strip plots to show the impact of specific features on match outcomes.

## Project Sections

### Section A - Data Exploration & Visualization

In this section, we explored the data using tables, visualizations, and other relevant methods. Key tasks included:
- Loading the data and displaying initial insights and statistics.
- Visualizing the distribution of match outcomes, goals scored by home and away teams, and trends over time.
- Creating plots to identify patterns, such as the frequency of shootouts and the impact of match location on outcomes.

### Section B - Data Preprocessing

This section involved preparing the data for modeling through various preprocessing steps:
- Handling missing values by imputation or dropping irrelevant columns.
- Feature engineering to create new informative features, such as win rates, average goals, and recent performance metrics.
- Normalizing and transforming data to ensure it was suitable for machine learning models.

### Section C - Home Team Winning Prediction

We used machine learning models to predict whether the home team won the match:
- Implemented three different models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.
- Conducted parameter tuning to optimize model performance.
- Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualized model results and compared their performance.

In this section, we applied clustering algorithms to group teams based on their performance:
- Created a dataset where each row represented a team and included features describing their game history.
- Applied K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering to identify team clusters.
- Tuned clustering parameters and evaluated cluster quality using various methods.
- Visualized clustering results to interpret similarities and differences between clusters.

### Section E - Clustering and Dimension Reduction (Bonus)

This section focused on reducing data dimensions and clustering:
- Used PCA to reduce the dimensions of team data while retaining most of the variance.
- Applied clustering algorithms to the reduced data and compared results with those obtained without PCA.
- Visualized clusters before and after PCA to understand the impact of dimension reduction.

### Section F - Exploring Players (Bonus)

This section explored individual player performance:
- Created a new dataset representing each player’s goal statistics.
- Formulated a question related to player performance and selected an appropriate machine learning algorithm to answer it.
